**Hello/Bonjour/سلام!**

I recently graduated with a **Master of Applied Science in Computer Engineering** from [York University](https://www.yorku.ca/)'s [Lassonde School of Engineering](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/) in December 2024. My thesis, titled *"Eye-Contact Behavior Modeling Using Diffusion Models"*, explored advanced techniques in computer vision and machine learning to simulate naturalistic eye-contact behaviors, contributing to the development of generative models for human-computer interaction. 

During my time at York University, I had the privilege of working with [Dr. Niko Troje](https://www.biomotionlab.ca/niko-troje/) and [Dr. Kosta Derpanis](https://csprofkgd.github.io/), whose guidance was instrumental in my research journey.

Prior to my master's, I earned my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering** from the [Iran University of Science and Technology](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en), where I developed a strong foundation in computational methods and artificial intelligence.

I am passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems and am excited to continue exploring opportunities in computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
