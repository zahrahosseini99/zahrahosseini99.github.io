**Hello/Bonjour/سلام!**

I am a Master of Applied Science in Computer Engineering student with a passion for solving complex problems using cutting-edge technologies. I am currently pursuing my degree at [York University](https://www.yorku.ca/)'s [Lassonde School of Engineering](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/) and focusing my research on computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 


I have been honored to work with [Dr. Niko Troje](https://www.biomotionlab.ca/niko-troje/), [Dr. Kosta Derpanis](https://csprofkgd.github.io/). 

Before joining York University, I received my BSc in Computer engineering from [Iran University of Scinece and Technology](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en).
