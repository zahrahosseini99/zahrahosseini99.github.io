I am a third-year computer engineering student. I studied mathematics at a Nodet high school
and finished high school with remarkable grades and had the opportunity
to gain some experience in the Iranian Mathematics Olympiad and Computer Olympiad. I first
started university as a material sciences student, but after participating in courses from other majors,
I realized my computer science passion. I believe that the worldâ€™s primary goal is to make others
happy, and I have always tried to help others in my way. In computer science major, I found projects
like speech-to-text transcription service for people with speaking impairments and computer vision
applications to automate the detection of eye diseases. These convinced me to continue my education
in the Computer Science field. Finally, I overcame the challenging conditions to change my major,
and now I hold a very high GPA in the computer science department. I will elaborate on my research
experience, course work, and teaching assistance experience in the following subsections.
