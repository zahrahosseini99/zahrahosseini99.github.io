  I am currently studying the final year of my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, Iran.
  My research interests include **Deep Learning** in particular, and **Machine Learning** in general, with applications in **Computer Vision** and **Graph Learning**. 
  I am intended to better understand these methods in a principled manner by investigating 
  both their underlying mathematics and their practical implications in real life. 
  Though the recent proposed techniques have demonstrated remarkable performance, 
  major challenges in terms of understanding their underlying mathematical foundations remain unresolved. 
  My research goal is to channel such better **theoretical and functional** understanding of 
  these new methods towards better **practical solutions** for real life problems.
